#+TITLE: CONNECTION TESTING WEB APPLICATION
#+AUTHOR: Toby Slight

A web based front end to a few essential network testing tools, written in PHP.

It can run iperf, iperf3, nslookup, ping and traceroute tests. A working set of
parameters are pre-filled.

If you want to learn more about the tools, and what parameters are available,
click on the cheatsheet or manual buttons.

The cheatsheet button gives a brief overview of what available parameters do, on
the same page. The manual button opens a new tab with the tool's manual page.

The latest 10 logs are displayed below allowing you to view or download previous
tests.

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04, running Apache 2.4 & PHP 7.2, and on a default MAMP
install.

iperf, iperf3, nslookup, ping & traceroute need to be installed in a $PATH
accessible to the apache user (www-data on Ubuntu), on the server, for the tool
to work. Curl is necessary for the cheatsheet function to work.
